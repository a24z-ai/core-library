# Globby Dependency Removal - Summary of Changes

## What Was Done

Successfully removed `globby` as a direct dependency from `@a24z/core-library` by implementing a GlobAdapter abstraction pattern.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created GlobAdapter Abstraction
- **`src/pure-core/abstractions/glob.ts`**: Interface defining glob operations contract
- Allows for different implementations without coupling to specific libraries

### 2. Implemented Multiple Adapters
- **`src/node-adapters/BasicGlobAdapter.ts`**: Default implementation using only Node.js built-ins
  - Supports common glob patterns (*, **, {extensions})
  - Handles .gitignore when requested
  - No external dependencies required

- **`src/node-adapters/NodeGlobAdapter.ts`**: Optional adapter for users who install globby separately
  - Full globby feature support
  - Requires manual installation of globby

- **`tests/test-adapters/InMemoryGlobAdapter.ts`**: Test implementation for unit testing
  - Works with InMemoryFileSystemAdapter
  - Enables testing without file system access

### 3. Updated Package Dependencies
- Moved `globby` from `dependencies` to `devDependencies`
- Removed unused `ignore` package from dependencies
- **Library now has ZERO runtime dependencies!** ðŸŽ‰

### 4. Modified Core Components
- **Rules Engine**: Now accepts optional GlobAdapter, defaults to BasicGlobAdapter
- **Document Organization Rule**: Uses injected GlobAdapter instead of direct globby import
- **Exports**: Updated to export BasicGlobAdapter by default

### 5. Documentation
- Created `docs/GLOBBY_MIGRATION.md` with migration guide for users
- Shows how to use built-in adapter or bring their own implementation

## Benefits

1. **Zero Dependencies**: From 2 runtime dependencies to ZERO
2. **Flexibility**: Users can choose their glob implementation
3. **Testability**: Better testing without external dependencies
4. **Consistency**: Follows existing FileSystemAdapter pattern
5. **Backward Compatible**: Users can still use globby if needed

## Testing

All tests pass with the new implementation:
- BasicGlobAdapter handles common use cases
- InMemoryGlobAdapter enables fast unit tests
- NodeGlobAdapter still works for those who need globby

## Migration Path for Users

1. **No action needed** for basic glob patterns - BasicGlobAdapter handles them
2. **Install globby separately** if advanced features are needed
3. **Implement custom adapter** for specific requirements

The abstraction successfully decouples the library from globby while maintaining functionality.
